Overview: This repository contains the AR Fourier method's implementation and comparisons to previously established methods. The comparison was done using both simulated and empirical datasets. We systematically compared AR Fourier to previously established techniques by generating simulated datasets with varying phase diffusion and noise coefficients. We also compared the method to other methods using a real word dataset from an awake macaque monkey's visual cortex while performing a detection task. 

More detailed information is provided in the notes file.
